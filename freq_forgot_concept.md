- p-value and alpha
alpha is set to value(normaly .05) to reject hull hypophesis, p-value is compute from sample, if p-value is less than alpha, reject, if greater, fail to reject.

to calculate p-value, get the dense curve and sum the area, aka, the porbability of a range from a value to a value, or range less/greater than a value

# p-value, alpha and critical value
- alpha is probability (set to normaly .05) to reject hull hypophesis, 
- critical value is where it is one x-axis, then area on the right is alpha(right tail)
- p-value is compute from sample, if p-value is less than alpha, reject, if greater, fail to reject.

to calculate p-value, get the dense curve and sum the area, aka, the porbability of a range from a value to a value, or range less/greater than a value. alpha and p-value is area(probability), critical value is a value.
